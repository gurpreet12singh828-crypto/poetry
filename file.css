    <div class="poem-card">
      <h3>Unsaid Words</h3>
      <p>
Some words remain silent,
Not because they are weak,
But because hearts are afraid
To let them speak.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-card">
      <h3>Loneliness</h3>
      <p>
I sit with a crowd,
Yet feel alone inside,
Smiling faces everywhere,
But my soul quietly cried.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-card">
      <h3>Hope</h3>
      <p>
Even in the darkest night,
A small star learns to shine,
Teaching broken hearts
That time will be kind.
